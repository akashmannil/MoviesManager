<h2>@ViewData["Title"]</h2>

<p>
    Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how our Movies Manager application 
    collects, uses, and safeguards the information you provide while using this website.
</p>

<h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Basic information you enter into the application (e.g., movie title, director, genre, cast, year, rating).</li>
    <li>No sensitive personal data is stored since this application uses only in-memory data and does not connect to a database.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. How We Use the Information</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To display and manage your movie collection within the Movies Manager application.</li>
    <li>To provide basic CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for demonstration purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Data Security</h3>
<p>
    The Movies Manager application does not store information permanently. All data is stored 
    temporarily in memory and is reset whenever the application restarts. 
    No data is shared with third parties.
</p>

<h3>4. Third-Party Services</h3>
<p>
    This project does not use third-party analytics, cookies, or advertisements. 
    It is strictly an educational project for demonstrating ASP.NET Core MVC.
</p>

<h3>5. Changes to This Policy</h3>
<p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in project requirements or to improve clarity. 
    Updated versions will replace the previous version on this page.
</p>

<h3>6. Contact</h3>
<p>
    If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the course instructor 
    or the project developer.
